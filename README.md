# HTML-linter
The main goal of this linter is to validate the HTML file and inform the customer about errors in the document. The user will get a sorted overview list with clearly marked items and suggestions on what to do.

Linter checks for seven types of errors and returns different messages for each situation along with the number of lines. 

It runs this set of tests:
- trailing spaces detection
- indentation by two: every line, except for the first and last, must be indented with an even number of spaces
- indentation of the first, and last not empty line must be zero. If the last line is not empty, it is going to trigger
   a different error.
- vertical indentation: must be different by zero or two compared to previous/next line (empty lines are ignored)
- open braces (unclosed tags) detection
- the last line must be empty
- missing alt detection.

All possible outcomes are accounted for:

- If there is a lot of offenses in a file

- if there is only one error in the file

- if an argument not given, the wrong document name entered or the file is empty

Results are displayed as a sorted list of lines containing offenses, along with the total count of errors.

## About linters

A linter is software that helps detect errors in the document. It is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))
